I grew up in Annapolis, Maryland then moving to Michigan for college. Growing up I enjoyed boating, water sports and playing lacrosse.  As I became older I realized that I wanted to play lacrosse in college and started the recruiting process. After looking at many schools I decided to attend Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan. I fell in love with the campus even under two feet of snow. As I came to school I knew I wanted to do something in the STEM field that would combined my love for math and building things. This lead to me getting a degree in Statistics while minoring in engineering. I realized after I was nearing my senior year I wanted to extend my knowledge by getting a masters in applied Statistics. I am currently in my first year of the program and enjoying everthing the program has to offer.
