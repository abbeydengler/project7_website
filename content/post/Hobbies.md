I have been a member of Grand Valley State Woman's Lacrosse team from 2016-present. As a member of a varsity sport I developed skills in leadership, teamwork, time-management, and communication.  I also received in 2017 GLIAC All-Academic team.

Besides lacrosse I can be found building or fixing something.  I have developed a love to do hands on projects. With quarantine I built a table along with multiple cornhole sets.  If my friends and teammates need help with fixing or hanging something, I am the one they call.
